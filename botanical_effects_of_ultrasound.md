# Botanical effect of ultrasonic waves

- Extensive research in this field is absent
- Studies suggest that 
    - Irreversible changes - could only be as severe as the death of plant cells
    - Reversible changes - chromosome absonormalities, mitotic index reductions, reduction in growth rate of roots (restored back in few hours or days depending on magnitude of ultrasound exposure) 

### Using ultrasound to automate pest management
- Use a PIR sensor to plot a thermal map and detect pests on the farm
- Use an ultrasonic transducer and an LM380 power amplifier to produce short and directed pulses of ultrasound in the frequency range of 50kHz to 80kHz
- Since prolonged exposure to ultrasound could lead to organogenesis, short bursts of ultrasound are used to drive pests away from plants
